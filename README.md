# 🧠 Automatic Ticket Classification & LLM-Powered Response System

**Key Skills:** NLP, Transformers, XLM-RoBERTa, LSTM, Generative AI, PyTorch, Python

- Built a multilingual ticket classification system trained on ~61,000 support tickets across 50+ queues  
- Compared TF-IDF + Logistic Regression, LSTM, mBERT, and XLM-RoBERTa models  
- Selected XLM-RoBERTa based on multilingual performance and accuracy  
- Implemented text preprocessing pipelines including cleaning, tokenization, and encoding  
- Designed confidence-aware routing (0.70 threshold) for safe automation  
- Routed low-confidence cases to human review  
- Generated Top-3 queue predictions for fallback decisions  
- Integrated Gemini API for empathetic automated responses  
- Added safety rules to avoid hallucinations or unrealistic commitments  
- Built an end-to-end pipeline from ticket input → routing → LLM response  
- Achieved 72%+ test accuracy and ~80% safe auto-routing  
- Focused on production-safe AI rather than just metrics
